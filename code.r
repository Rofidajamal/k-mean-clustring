
#You are required to apply k-mean clustering on the dataset. You have to go through these steps.
#â€¢ Import dataset
# You need to understand this dataset and know what it needs to be clustered.
# Extract your features from the data.
# Make estimation about what you need to cluster and what these data tells you how samples do you have etc.
# Pre-processing
# Your dataset needs to be ready for the training step. So you need to filter your necessary information.
# Normalizing your data is necessary in this step. (if you have picked up a data that is already normalized then you will get this step points)
# Training the model
# What is your suitable k according to your problem?
# Evaluate your model
# What are your clusters and their centres?
# What is your error function? Manhattan distance or Euclidian distance
# Plot your clusters
# Justify what is the meaning of these clusters according to your problem?
